***\*\*\*NOTE:*** this readme was nearly entirely copied from it's origin repo at: https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow

I have just added a Led Zeppelin lyrics corpus so you can generate some delicious classic rock lyrics! (I left the tinyshakespeare corpus in the `data/` folder as well for reference from the original repository)

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for word-level language models in Python using TensorFlow - Led Zeppelin style!

Mostly reused code from https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow which was inspired from Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow 1.1.0rc0](http://www.tensorflow.org)

# Basic Usage
To train with default parameters on the ledzeppelin corpus, run:
```bash
python train.py
```

To sample from a trained model
```bash
python sample.py
```

To pick using beam search, use the `--pick` parameter. Beam search can be
further customized using the `--width` parameter, which sets the number of beams
to search with. For example:
```bash
python sample.py --pick 2 --width 4
```

# Sample output
